## Introduction

We're going to look at some forest ecology data

Set things up

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) #clear R's brain 
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


Now pull in some data
```{r}
Trees <- read.csv(here("Data", "Forest_Trees_17_21.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
#string = character data
#factors = categorical data 
```
